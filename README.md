### POINTS TO NOTE
- After WS06, instead of having a lab and a DIY to solve, our workshops were divided into two parts. The first part is a lab and the second part is just a reflection.
- The final project is divided into 5 milestones and the fifth milestone is further divided into six parts.

# Disclaimer
Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself, it's totally pointless if you actually wanna learn how to write software and a blatant violation of the [Academic Integrity](https://www.senecacollege.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html) policy of the course.
