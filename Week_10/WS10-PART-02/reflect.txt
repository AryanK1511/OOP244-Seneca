I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop, I learnt how to code function templates and implement calls to function templates. 

Basically I implemented two find() functions in this workshop which helped us to find an element in an array of a collection that was given to us earlier. However, in order to implement these find functions, we need an object of any collection type. A collection type could be a Card, a Book or a Pet. We would use this object to store the element that we found. Also, we need an Array which contains values/keys that we use to find elements in the object. Finally, we need the array where we will find the elements in.

The find function is designed to be used with any type of collection because we have used function templates in the function definition.

The main problem that I faced in this workshop is that I was getting some errors in the 3 argument find() template function. This was because the order of arguments that I specified in the function call was not correct. My professor helped me to catch this problem and hence, solve it.

Function Definition:
template <typename type1, typename type2>
bool find(type1 arr[], type2 key, int index) {
    return (arr[index] == key);
}

Erroneous Call:
find("Hearts", C, ii)

Corrected Call:
find(C, "Hearts", ii)
