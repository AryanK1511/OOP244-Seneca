I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

This workshop gave me an opportunity to revise all the concepts that I learnt last semester as a part of IPC144. Concepts such structs, arrays and file handling were made very clear through this workshop.

The main difficulty that I faced was while doing the 'loadQuiz()' function. This is because I had to read the whole file and had to differentiate between questions and answers. I also had to make sure that I keep an account of the right answers while storing data so I could validate user input later in the program. To solve this, I used index numbers to keep track of the right answer.

// Struct to store the answer details for a multiple choice question
struct MCAnswerDetails {
    char answers[MAX_ANSWERS][ANSWER_TEXT];
    int rightAnswerIndex;
};

// Struct to store the answer details for a multiple answer question
struct MAAnswerDetails {
    char answers[MAX_ANSWERS][ANSWER_TEXT];
    int rightAnswerIndexes[MAX_ANSWERS];
};

As thee multiple answer questions could have had more than  one correct answer, I used an array to store the indexes of the right answers.
