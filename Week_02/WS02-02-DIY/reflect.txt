I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

This workshop helped me to learn many concepts such as Dynamic Memory allocation and References. I learnt how we can store the data that we read from CSV files in dynamically allocated array of structs. I also dynamically allocated memory to store strings in the struct.

The main problem that I faced in my code was a memory leak because i was deallocating more memory than I allocated. To solve this I just changed the limit.

Erroneous Code: Tries to deallocate memory for an array of structs which stores all records in the file
for (i = 0; i < noOfEmployees; i++) {
    delete[] employees[i].employeeName;
}

Corrected Code: Only deallocates memory for the array of structs which stores the records where month was matched
for (i = 0; i < monthMatches; i++) {
    delete[] employees[i].employeeName;
}

I also faced a segmentation faults but the professor helped me with it. I faced the fault because I was accessing memory which was out of the range of the array.
